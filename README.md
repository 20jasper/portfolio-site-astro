# portfolio site astro

Jacob Asper's web development portfolioâ€”now in astro!

[Live site](https://jacobasper.com/)

## motivations

[My original portfolio](https://github.com/20jasper/portfolio-site) is built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so as it grew, it became cumbersome to update. Once there were enough projects to warrant pagination, not only did I need to move all the projects to across pages manually, I needed to create a new form in Netlify for each page.

Migrating to [Astro](https://astro.build/) will help quite a bit with these issues since it offers built in pagination and components. The cherry on top is that astro uses SSG, so there won't be any performance cost!
