# portfolio site solid
Jacob Asper's web development portfolioâ€”now in solid!

## motivations
My original site built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript became a bit cumbersome to work with once there were enough projects to warrant pagination. Not only did I need to move all the projects back after I finished a new one, I needed to create a new form in Netlify for each page. 

Migrating to Solid will solve these problems with little overhead, and I'm interested in trying out another JavaScript framework anyways!

## scripts
